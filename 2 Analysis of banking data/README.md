# Loan Solvency Analysis

## 📝 Task

Analyze customer solvency statistics to determine whether **marital status** and the **presence of children** influence the likelihood of **timely loan repayment**.

---

## 📊 Key Findings

- 👶 **Children Increase Risk**: Borrowers with children are more likely to have overdue loans.
- 💍 **Marital Status Matters**: Single or cohabiting individuals tend to miss loan repayments more often than those in formal relationships.
- 💰 **Income Level is Crucial**: High-income clients are significantly less likely to default.
- 🏡 **Loan Purpose Influences Risk**: Real estate loans are less frequently overdue compared to other loan types.

---

## 📌 Conclusion

While both marital status and the presence of children affect debt risk, **they are not sufficient alone** for accurate predictions. A more reliable assessment includes:

- **Income Level**: Stable, high income lowers the risk—even for clients with multiple children.
- **Loan Type**: Real estate loans (e.g., for personal housing) are treated more responsibly than others, such as auto loans.

Therefore, a comprehensive credit risk evaluation should incorporate **multiple factors**, not just family status.
