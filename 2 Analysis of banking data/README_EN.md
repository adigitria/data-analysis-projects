** Tasks **

Based on statistics on the solvency of customers, to explore whether the marital status and the presence of children affect the fact of the loan on time

** conclusions **

- the presence of children increases the likelihood of debt;
- unmarried/unmarried and living in a civil marriage often do not return the loan on time;
- borrowers with high income less often become debtors;
- Real estate loans are less likely to the rest in the expired.

On the main issue from the customer, we can say that, regardless of marital status, the presence of children in borrowers increases the risk of appearance
Credit debts are true and the opposite, regardless of the number of children for customers who are or previously former in official family relations,
Less often occurs debts on a loan.

To assess the risk of debt, two categories are not enough. The analysis shows that the level of income greatly affects
on the occurrence of debt (for example, if the client has high income and 5 children, this does not increase the risk of debt as low and unstable income
At the borrower). Real estate loans are less common, for example, their own housing is a more important and responsible aspect of life,
than a car. These categories should also be taken into account.
