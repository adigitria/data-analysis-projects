Conclusions

The entire assortment of the store is classified from the position of ABS-analysis according to the following criteria (in brackets the range of categories in the corresponding units):

Category A is the average in terms of the number of unique goods category - 609 goods (26%), where the most commonly sold and cheap goods are located,
With the highest average check, average revenue, but at the same time the smallest number of orders.

Category B is the smallest category in terms of the number of goods - 593 goods (25%), medium -sized goods with cheap and medium price have got into this group,

He will find something for himself even in a single copy.

We appropriated quantitative categories of ABC the same categories in revenue.

Category AB - High goods for the number of sales and average in revenue.

Category of the Armed Forces - goods with an average level of turnover and low volume of revenue.
