# 📱 Mobile App Funnel Analysis & A/A/B Testing

## 📝 Task

Analyze **user behavior** within a mobile food delivery app by:
- Evaluating the **sales funnel**
- Conducting an **A/A/B test** to assess the impact of a visual change (font update)

---

## 📊 Key Findings

- 🔻 **Funnel Drop-off**:
  - ~40% of users do **not proceed past the main screen**
  - Only **~62%** of users reach the product selection screen (Groups 246, 247, 248: 62.9%, 61.6%, 61.5%)
  - Less than **50% complete a purchase** (Groups: 48.9%, 46.7%, 47.4%)

- 🧪 **A/A/B Test Results**:
  - No **statistically significant difference** between groups
  - **Font change** had **no measurable impact** on user behavior

- 🧠 **Recommendations**:
  - Investigate the **purpose of the font change**:
    - If **purely visual**, consider reverting
    - If addressing **technical/display issues**, proceed with changes
  - Urgently review the **main screen experience**:
    - High drop-off indicates potential UX or performance issues

## ✅ Conclusion

While the font update did not harm engagement, it also didn’t improve it. The key issue lies in the **main screen**, where most users exit the funnel. This area should be prioritized for **UX testing and optimization**.
