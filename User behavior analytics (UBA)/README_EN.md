Based on the use of a mobile application for the sale of food products, to analyze a sales funnel, as well as evaluate the results of A/A/B testing.

Conclusions

- About 40% of users do not pass further than the main screen (only 62.9%, 61.6% and 61.5%, respectively, for groups 246, 247 and 248, go to the screen with the choice of goods),
And less than half of users reach successful payment (48.9% 6 46.7% and 47.4%, respectively, for groups 246, 247 and 248);

- checking statistical hypotheses showed that there is no statistically significant difference between the samples;

- Based on the results of the a/a/b - test, we note that the change in the font to the behavior of users did not have a significant effect,
The changes made will definitely not reduce the activity of users.
We recommend that you figure out why the font was changing for - if it is only a visual moment, then it should not be changed if the font change is due
technical problems, the solution of which can improve the application of the application, then the changes should be applied;
We also recommend checking the operation of the main screen, are there any errors in display, because After this event, we lose the largest number of users.
