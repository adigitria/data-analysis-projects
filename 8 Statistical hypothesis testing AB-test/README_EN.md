Tasks

Using the data of the online store to prioritize hypotheses, evaluate the results of A/B testing with various methods.

Conclusions

- there is a statistically significant difference in the conversion between groups both in “raw” data and after filtering of anomalies;
- both in the "raw" and in "purified" data there is no statistically significant difference in the average check between the groups, so the resulting relative
The difference between the average checks of groups A and B is considered random;
- a schedule for the difference between the conversion between groups reports that the results of group B are better than the group A: tend to growth or recorded near average value;
- the schedule of the distinction of the average check hesitates, anomalies were investigated by a benevolence;

Based on the results, the test should be stopped and recognized as successful, taking the group in the best segment.
